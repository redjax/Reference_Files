# pre-commit

Config files for [`pre-commit`](https://pre-commit.com/). These files define `.pre-commit-config.yml` files, which can be used to trigger actions on files as files are being committed locally.

Useful for things like stripping `jupyter` notebooks, running `rough` linting or `black` formatting, scanning repo for known vulnerabilities, etc.
